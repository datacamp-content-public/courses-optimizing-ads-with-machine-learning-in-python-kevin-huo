## Sklearn's metric module

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "c8e8c52ed8"
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`
```
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
```
- Both functions take in two arrays as arguments, one with ground truth labels, and one with model predicted labels
- Both work with simple binary and multi-class classifiers


`@script`
Sklearn's metric module contains two important functions for evaluating classifiers. We will be using two of these functions, classification_report() and accuracy() in evaluating our logistic regression classifier. Both of these take in two arrays as inputs: one array with ground truth labels (in our case, whether or not a given ad was clicked by a particular person), and one array with predicted labels (our model predicting a click or not). Both functions also apply to both binary and multi-class classifiers. Since in our case we are interested in the binary setup (ad being clicked or not), these functions will be more than enough to evaluate our logistic regression classifier.

## The classification_report() and accuracy() functions

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "e7c21f53a7"
```

`@part1`
```
Y_true, Y_pred = Y_test, clf.predict(Y_test)
classification_report(Y_true, Y_pred)
accuracy_score(Y_true, Y_pred)
```


`@script`
As before, the inputs to the classification_report function are 1. An array called "Y_true" which contains the ground truth labels on our testing examples, and 2. An array called "Y_pred" which contains the output that our logistic regression classifier has for our testing examples. The classification_report() function outputs a text summary of some key metrics for classifiers that looks like a table when printed. The two metrics we will focus on are: precision and recall.
